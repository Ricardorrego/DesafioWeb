# DesafioWebSite
Desafio Prática

## Steps by Steps:
### 1. Download Project
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Ricardorrego/DesafioWeb.git
cd DesafioWeb
```

### 2. Installing gems
To install All gems:
```shell
bundle install
```

### 3. Download Driver:
Install and include in PATH
- [chromedriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/)
<br> or install gem chromedriver-helper
```shell
gem install chromedriver-helper
```

### 4. Run Tests: 
### Run tests in DEV with Chrome
Type this in the tests folder:
```shell
cucumber -p pretty -p html -p dev -p sem_headless
```

### Run tests in DEV with headless
Type this in the tests folder:
```shell
cucumber -p html -p dev -p com_headless
```

### Run tests in HMG with Chrome
Type this in the tests folder:
```shell
cucumber -p pretty -p html -p homolog -p sem_headless
```

### Run tests in HMG with headless
Type this in the tests folder:
```shell
cucumber -p html -p homolog -p com_headless
```

### Run with tags
Type this in the tests folder:
```shell
cucumber -t @criar_novo_cliente
```

### RakeFile - of reduced form we can use rake framework.
Type this in the tests folder:
```shell
rake test_chrome_dev
```

```shell
rake test_chrome_dev_headless
```

```shell
rake test_chrome_hmg

```shell
rake test_chrome_hmg_headless
```

#### Pre-conditions:

    Ruby 2.3.3 or 2.4.4
    Navegador Chrome Updated
    chromedriver
    Gems do ruby (Gemfile)
    Data Mass - Fake gem.


### Basic Structure Project:

**Specfications:** Where is the functionality of the project.

**Steps Definitions:** Where the actual tests are performed.

**Pages:** Where the elements and methods of a particular page are mapped.

**Support:** Where is the project settings.

**Results:** Where is the result of the tests and reports.

**Data:** Mass of Data for tests.

 **Framework:** The framework folder contains classes or modules with global functions to reduce code in Pages.


### Basic BDD:
Cucumber executes executable specifications written in plain language and produces reports indicating whether the software behaves according to the specification or not.
- **Feature** The purpose of the Feature keyword is to provide a high-level description of a software feature, and to group related scenarios.
- **Scenario** is a written example to illustrate a specific aspect of application behavior.
- Each step starts with Given, When, Then, And, or But. 
- **Given** steps are used to describe the initial context of the system.  
- **When** steps are used to describe an event, or an action.  
- **Then** steps are used to describe an expected outcome, or result.  
- **And, But** use If you have several Given’s, When’s, or Thens.
- **Data Tables** are handy for passing a list of values to a step definition.
